## Description
Terminightor is a simple alarm clock for Android with a spicy special. In order to put off an alarm you have to hold a NFC tag related to that alarm onto your phone. Unless you do that the alarm will not stop, even if you try to kill the Terminightor service.

So if you put a tag into for example your bathroom, and set up an alarm with that tag to put the alarm off, it will ensure that you really get up in the morning.

## Features:
* repeat/don't repeat alarms
* repeat alarms only on certain weak days
* custom ringtone
* put vibration on/off
* put alarms off via NFC tag
